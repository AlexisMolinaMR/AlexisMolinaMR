### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


I'm an AI specialist doing research at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center and developing cool stuff at Nostrum Biodiscovery. I work on the verge of AI and biology trying to tackle a wide range of problems on the fields of drug discovery and design and enzyme engineering. Machine and deep learning techniques and their applications in biology and healthcare are my main interests but I also enjoy teaching and writing articles for scientific communication!

### Currently...

- ... working on scoring functions for ligand using algebraic graphs and AI ðŸ’»
- ... ligand property predictions :diamonds:
- ... and also on generative models for _de novo_ drug and enzyme design ðŸ’Š
- ... sequence-based PPI predictions :twisted_rightwards_arrows:
